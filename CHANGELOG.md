# 0.6.2.0

* Cleared `hspec` upper bound
* Qualified all Data.List imports
* Fixed tests to work with newer (>=0.4) neat-interpolation (#30)
* Adjusted lower bounds of formatting dependency to avoid unsigned 0
  issues (#31)
* fixed floatF handling of negative numbers (#36)
* unconfused ``||++|`` and ``|++||`` (#29)

# 0.6.1.2

* Bumped the `hspec` upper bound.
* Fixed doctests.

# 0.6.1.1

* Added `HasCallStack` to partial functions.

# 0.6.1

* Added `instance FromBuilder ByteString` (for both lazy and strict
  bytestrings) and `instance FromBuilder BS.Builder`. These instances
  generate UTF8-encoded bytestrings. This allows producing formatting
  strings for various HTTP libraries that are intent on using `ByteString`
  for text.

* Added `pretty :: (Buildable a, FromBuilder b) => a -> b` for formatting
  anything as `Buildable`. There's also `prettyLn` for consistency with
  `fmt` and `fmtLn`.

# 0.6

* Switched to `Buildable` from `formatting` (since `text-format` is
  unmaintained).

* Removed the `double-conversion` dependency (which was sometimes causing
  compilation issues). As the result, `exptF`, `fixedF` and `floatF` have
  become slower.

* The `precF` formatter was removed completely because its semantics was too
  confusing. You can use `Numeric.showGFloat` to achieve a similar effect.

* `floatF` now always prints a point, even if the number is integral.

* `tupleLikeF` has been removed. `TupleF` now has an additional instance
  that lets `tupleF` be used to format lists.

* The `base16-bytestring` dependency was removed.

* Compatibility with GHC 7.6 and 7.8 was dropped.

# 0.5.0.0

* From this version on, `blockListF` never puts blank lines between items.
  If you want blank lines between items, I'm afraid that you'll have to add
  them manually (by e.g. adding a blank line to each item).

* Now `blockListF'` can be used to create lists with custom bullets.

* Added `unwordsF` and `unlinesF`.

* Added the `F` suffix to `indent` and `indent'`.

# 0.4.0.0

* Renamed `#|` and `|#` to `+|` and `|+` because HLint can't handle `#|` and
  everyone uses HLint apparently.

# 0.3.0.0

* Added time formatters (see `Fmt.Time`).

# 0.2.0.0

* Changed `format` and `formatLn` to be polyvariadic.

# 0.1.0.0

* Added `genericF` for formatting arbitrary data.

* Changed `%<` and `>%` to `#|` and `|#` because they turn out to be easier
  to type.

* Added a migration guide from `formatting`.

* Changed output of `eitherF`.

* Added bechmarks.

# 0.0.0.4

* Added `format` from `text-format`, because in some cases it's nicer than
  brackets.

* Renamed `padCenterF` to `padBothF`.

* Modified `indent` and `indent'` to always add newlines.

# 0.0.0.3

* Wrote documentation.

* Added some formatters:

    * `indent`
    * formatters for lists, maps and tuples (`listF`, etc)
    * `octF`, `binF`, `baseF` and floating-point formatters
    * `hexF` which works on both numbers and bytestrings
    * `ordinalF` and `commaizeF`
    * padding and trimming formatters
    * `base64F` and `base64UrlF`
    * conditionals (`whenF` and `unlessF`)

* Merged `Fmt.IO` with `Fmt` because orphan instances are controversial.

* Exported internal classes and functions from `Fmt.Internal`.

* Added `fmt` and `fmtLn`.

* Made all operators associate to the right (`Builder` documentation says
  it's faster than the opposite).

* Reexported `Buildable` and `Builder`.

# 0.0.0.2

* Added `>%%<` so that it'd be possible to write `%<a>%%<b>%` instead of
  weird `%<a%<b>%`.

* Added `%<< ... >>%`, which work work `Show` instead of `Buildable`. If you
  don't care about speed and just want to output something, use them.

* Added an `IO ()` instance in `Fmt.IO`. If you import that module, raw
  formatted strings would print themselves.

* Added tests.

* Changed fixities of operators so that `%<n+1>%` would work.

* Changed license to BSD3 since all our dependencies are BSD3 and we can't
  use MIT.

# 0.0.0.1

First (completely experimental) release.
